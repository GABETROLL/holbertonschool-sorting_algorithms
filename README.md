# holbertonschool-sorting\_algorithms
Learn with me and Holberton about sorting algorithms and time complexity.
## Directory:
All files that start with the same number talk about the same algorithm.
The _swap.c_ file has the swap operation, which is used in multiple algorithms.
The _print\_array.c_ and _print\_list_ just contain one function that just prints
an array or a doubly linked list.
Finally, the header file puts it all together. Enjoy!

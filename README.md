Learn with me and Holberton about sorting algorithms and time complexity.
## Directory:
All files that start with the same number talk about the same algorithm.
The _print\_array.c_ and _print\_list_ just contain one function that just prints
an array or a doubly linked list, and a swap operation for the corresponding data type.
Finally, the header file puts it all together. Enjoy!
